###Project Summary:


This project provides fast and easy way to analyze the Malware Traces and finding the patterns between them through interaction and visualization.

**Problem : **
The reports generated during analysis of malware consist of large number of API and system process calls. If we manually analyze this report itâ€™s difficult to keep track of malware activities and finding patterns which makes it difficult to categorize the malware or finding some patterns between them.

**Solution : **
When malware infects any system it makes many standard system calls. These call remains almost same with new versions of the malware. Thus we created visualization to see the pattern of malware activity and identify its family.
